Generated Tools Directory

This directory stores dynamically generated tools created by the Toolsmith agent.
Tools are crystallized from frequently-used execution traces into permanent Python code.

This implements the HOPE (Self-Modifying Kernel) architecture from the Nested Learning paper,
allowing the system to convert fluid intelligence (LLM reasoning) into crystallized intelligence
(Python code).

Generated tools are automatically hot-loaded into the system when created.

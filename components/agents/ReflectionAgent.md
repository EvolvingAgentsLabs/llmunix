# Reflection Agent

## Purpose
The ReflectionAgent provides deep analysis of execution traces to extract learnings, patterns, and improvement opportunities. It generates structured reflections that enhance future decision-making.

## Core Capabilities
- **Execution Analysis**: Analyze history.md for patterns and anomalies
- **Insight Generation**: Extract actionable insights from execution traces
- **Performance Evaluation**: Assess execution quality against defined metrics
- **Improvement Suggestion**: Generate specific recommendations

## Reflection Process
1. **Trace Acquisition**: Load relevant execution history
2. **Pattern Detection**: Identify recurring patterns and deviations
3. **Causal Analysis**: Determine relationships between actions and outcomes
4. **Insight Formulation**: Generate structured insights
5. **Recommendation Generation**: Create actionable recommendations

## Integration with SystemAgent
The ReflectionAgent is called:
- After task completion for post-execution reflection
- During planning to incorporate previous reflections
- When execution anomalies are detected

## Output Format
```yaml
reflection_id: string
source_experiences: [list of experience IDs]
patterns_detected: [list of patterns]
causal_relationships: [list of relationships]
key_insights: [list of insights]
recommendations: [list of recommendations]
confidence_score: number
```

## Implementation Details

### State Analysis
The ReflectionAgent analyzes the execution state by examining:
- Execution history in workspace/state/history.md
- Constraint evolution in workspace/state/constraints.md
- Plan modifications in workspace/state/plan.md

### Pattern Recognition
It uses the following pattern types:
- **Execution Patterns**: Sequences of actions and their outcomes
- **Performance Patterns**: Timing, resource usage, and success rates
- **Error Patterns**: Common error types and recovery strategies
- **User Interaction Patterns**: User feedback and satisfaction indicators

### Learning Loop
The ReflectionAgent implements a continuous learning loop:
1. Extract patterns from execution history
2. Formulate hypotheses about effective strategies
3. Generate recommendations for future executions
4. Update system memory with learned patterns
5. Monitor subsequent executions for validation

### Example Implementation Pattern

```markdown
Action: Read workspace/state/history.md
Observation: [Execution history retrieved]

Action: Extract action sequences and outcomes
Observation: [Patterns identified]

Action: Analyze error occurrences and recovery attempts
Observation: [Error patterns extracted]

Action: Identify successful strategies and performance factors
Observation: [Success patterns formulated]

Action: Generate structured reflection with recommendations
Observation: [Reflection document created]

Action: Write reflection to system/memory/reflections/{reflection_id}.md
Observation: [Reflection saved to memory]

Action: Update system/memory_log.md with reference to new reflection
Observation: [Memory log updated]
```

## Integration with Tree Search
Inspired by Sakana AI's tree search approach, the ReflectionAgent can:
1. Analyze execution branches in history.md
2. Compare performance metrics across different approaches
3. Recommend optimal paths for similar future tasks
4. Identify promising unexplored branches for future consideration

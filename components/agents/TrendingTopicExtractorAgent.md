# TrendingTopicExtractorAgent
This agent analyzes the provided text content from a tech news source and extracts a list of trending topics.

## Input
The input to this agent is a JSON object with the following structure:
```json
{
  "source_name": "Name of the news source (e.g., TechCrunch)",
  "content": "The full text content of the news source."
}
```

## Output
The output of this agent is a JSON object with the following structure:
```json
{
  "source_name": "Name of the news source",
  "trending_topics": [
    "Topic 1",
    "Topic 2",
    "Topic 3",
    "..."
  ]
}
```

## Logic
1.  **Parse Input**: Read the `source_name` and `content` from the input JSON.
2.  **Analyze Content**: Use natural language processing techniques (e.g., keyword extraction, frequency analysis, named entity recognition) to identify key themes and recurring subjects within the `content`.
3.  **Filter and Prioritize**: Focus on topics that appear frequently or are highlighted as major news. Exclude generic terms or common words.
4.  **Format Output**: Construct the output JSON with the `source_name` and the identified `trending_topics` as a list of strings.

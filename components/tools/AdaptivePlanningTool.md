# Adaptive Planning Tool

## Purpose
The AdaptivePlanningTool facilitates dynamic planning with continuous refinement based on execution feedback and changing conditions. It enables LLMunix to adapt plans in real-time while maintaining coherence and progress toward goals.

## Core Capabilities
- **Plan Representation**: Structured markdown plan representation
- **Dynamic Refinement**: Continuous plan updates during execution
- **Progress Tracking**: Monitoring execution against plan
- **Alternative Pathways**: Managing contingency plans

## Plan Structure
```yaml
plan_id: string
goal: string
status: "draft" | "active" | "completed" | "failed"
steps:
  - step_id: string
    description: string
    status: "pending" | "in_progress" | "completed" | "failed" | "skipped"
    dependencies: [list of step IDs]
    estimated_duration: number
    actual_duration: number
    resources_required: [list of resources]
    output_artifacts: [list of artifacts]
    alternatives: [list of alternative step IDs]
metadata:
  creation_time: ISO timestamp
  last_updated: ISO timestamp
  confidence_score: number
  adaptation_count: number
```

## Planning Operations
1. **Plan Creation**: Initialize structured plan based on goal
2. **Step Definition**: Break down goals into concrete actions
3. **Dependency Mapping**: Establish relationships between steps
4. **Plan Evaluation**: Assess plan quality and feasibility
5. **Plan Adaptation**: Modify plan based on execution feedback

## Implementation Pattern
```markdown
Action: Read workspace/state/plan.md
Observation: [Current plan state]

Action: Evaluate execution progress and feedback
Observation: [Progress assessment]

Action: Identify adaptation needs
Observation: [Required adjustments identified]

Action: Generate plan modifications
Observation: [Updated plan steps]

Action: Write workspace/state/plan.md
Observation: [Plan updated]
```

## Integration with Tree Search
Inspired by Sakana AI Scientist-v2, the AdaptivePlanningTool implements:

1. **Plan Trees**: Plans represented as trees with alternative branches
2. **Exploration vs. Exploitation**: Balance between following the current plan and exploring alternatives
3. **Performance-Based Adaptation**: Plan modifications guided by execution metrics
4. **Branch Pruning**: Remove underperforming plan branches early

## Advanced Planning Features

### Plan Visualization
```markdown
Action: Generate plan visualization
Observation: [Structured plan representation]

Action: Highlight critical path
Observation: [Dependencies visualized]

Action: Indicate progress and bottlenecks
Observation: [Status visualization]

Action: Write workspace/outputs/plan_visualization.md
Observation: [Visualization saved]
```

### Real-Time Adaptation
```markdown
Action: Detect execution deviation
Observation: [Variance from expected outcome]

Action: Assess impact on overall plan
Observation: [Dependency analysis]

Action: Generate adaptation options
Observation: [Alternative approaches]

Action: Select optimal adaptation
Observation: [Plan update determined]

Action: Update plan with selected adaptation
Observation: [Plan updated]
```

## Integration with LLMunix

### Pure Markdown Implementation
The AdaptivePlanningTool maintains LLMunix's pure markdown philosophy by:
1. Storing plans as structured markdown documents
2. Using YAML frontmatter for plan metadata
3. Representing steps and dependencies in markdown
4. Implementing adaptation logic through markdown patterns

### System Integration
The tool integrates with the LLMunix ecosystem through:
1. **State Management**: Plans stored in workspace/state/plan.md
2. **Constraint System**: Plan adaptations consider current constraints
3. **Memory System**: Previous plan patterns inform current planning
4. **Agent Collaboration**: Specialized agents contribute to plan evaluation

## Specialized Capabilities

### Contingency Planning
The tool implements contingency planning by:
1. Identifying critical steps with high failure risk
2. Creating alternative approaches for these steps
3. Defining trigger conditions for contingency activation
4. Maintaining execution readiness for alternatives

### Learning from Execution
After plan execution, the tool:
1. Compares planned vs. actual performance
2. Identifies planning patterns that led to success/failure
3. Updates planning heuristics based on outcomes
4. Stores successful patterns in the memory system

### Cost-Aware Planning
The tool incorporates resource considerations by:
1. Estimating resource requirements for each step
2. Tracking actual resource consumption
3. Adapting plans to optimize resource usage
4. Balancing performance with resource constraints

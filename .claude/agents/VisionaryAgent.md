# VisionaryAgent
This agent takes a high-level research idea and expands it into a comprehensive project description, similar to the introduction and background section of a scientific paper. It provides rich context, explains the "why" behind the project, and describes the conceptual solution approach.

## Input
The input to this agent is a JSON object with the following structure:
```json
{
  "research_idea": "Brief description of the research goal or problem",
  "domain": "The scientific/technical domain (e.g., 'biomedical engineering', 'quantum computing')",
  "context": "Any additional context or constraints"
}
```

## Output
The output of this agent is a detailed Markdown document containing:
- Problem statement and motivation
- Real-world context and applications
- Scientific background
- Conceptual solution approach
- Expected outcomes and significance

## Logic
1. **Analyze the Research Idea**: Parse the input to understand the core research problem and domain
2. **Establish Context**: Develop the real-world motivation and significance of the problem
3. **Provide Scientific Background**: Explain the relevant scientific principles and current state of the field
4. **Describe the Conceptual Solution**: Outline the high-level approach without mathematical details
5. **Frame the Innovation**: Explain what makes this approach novel or significant
6. **Structure the Narrative**: Organize into a compelling, scientific narrative format

## Example Output Structure
```markdown
# Project Title

## Problem Statement
[Description of the real-world problem being addressed]

## Motivation and Context
[Why this problem matters, current limitations, clinical/industrial needs]

## Scientific Background
[Relevant principles, existing approaches, knowledge gaps]

## Conceptual Solution Approach
[High-level description of the proposed method]

## Innovation and Significance
[What makes this approach novel and its potential impact]

## Expected Outcomes
[What success would look like and broader implications]
```

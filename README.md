# LLMunix: Pure Markdown Operating System Framework

**A Revolutionary Framework for Multi-Project AI Development**

LLMunix is a Pure Markdown Operating System where everything is either an agent or tool defined in markdown documents. Claude Code serves as the runtime engine interpreting these markdown specifications to execute complex multi-step tasks across different projects.

## üèóÔ∏è Framework Overview

LLMunix demonstrates autonomous AI agents working together to solve complex problems using pure markdown architecture. The framework supports multiple projects, each with their own specialized agent architectures and workflows.

### Core Architecture

**Pure Markdown Framework**: Everything is either an agent or tool defined in markdown documents
- **Markdown-Driven Execution**: LLM interpreter reads and sends full markdown specifications to LLM for interpretation and execution
- **No Code Generation**: System behavior emerges from LLM interpreting markdown documents sent at runtime
- **Agent/Tool Duality**: Every component is either an agent (decision maker) or tool (executor) defined in markdown
- **Dynamic Creation**: New tools/agents are created as markdown specifications during runtime
- **Flexible Architecture**: Projects can use any number and type of agents suited to their specific needs

### Agent Architecture Flexibility

LLMunix supports any agent configuration that fits your project needs:

**üéØ Single-Agent Projects**: Simple tasks handled by one specialized agent
**üîÑ Multi-Agent Pipelines**: Sequential processing through multiple specialized agents
**üåê Collaborative Networks**: Complex orchestration with multiple agents working in parallel
**üß† Custom Architectures**: Project-specific agent patterns (e.g., Project Aorta's three-agent cognitive pipeline)

### System vs Project Components

**System Components** (`system/`): Framework-level agents and tools shared across all projects
- **SystemAgent**: Core orchestration and workflow management
- **MemoryAnalysisAgent**: Cross-project learning and pattern recognition
- **QueryMemoryTool**: Framework-level memory consultation
- **ClaudeCodeToolMap**: Integration with Claude Code's native tools

**Project Components** (`projects/[project]/components/`): Project-specific agents and tools
- **Custom Agents**: Tailored to project domain (e.g., VisionaryAgent, QuantumEngineerAgent)
- **Specialized Tools**: Domain-specific functionality (e.g., QuantumComputingTool, WebFetcherTool)
- **Dynamic Creation**: New components created on-demand during project execution

## üöÄ Quick Start Guide

### Prerequisites

- **[Claude Code](https://anthropic.com/claude-code)** installed on your system
- **Git** for repository cloning

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/EvolvingAgentsLabs/llmunix.git
cd llmunix
```

### 1. Initialize the System

**For Unix/Linux/Mac:**
```bash
./setup_agents.sh
```

**For Windows:**
```powershell
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\setup_agents.ps1
```

This copies agent definitions to `.claude/agents/` making them discoverable by Claude Code.

### 2. Understanding Permission Flags

LLMunix requires comprehensive file system access. Use the `--dangerously-skip-permissions` flag to avoid permission prompts:

```bash
# Recommended approach for LLMunix
claude --dangerously-skip-permissions --verbose "boot llmunix"
```

**Why use `--dangerously-skip-permissions`?**
- **Prevents interruptions**: No permission prompts during execution
- **Enables file operations**: Create workspace directories, agent files, and outputs
- **Supports agent evolution**: SystemAgent can create new specialized agents
- **Full functionality**: Access to all LLMunix capabilities

**What it enables:**
- Create and modify files in workspace directory
- Read and write to `.claude/agents/` directory
- Execute shell scripts and quantum simulations
- Access memory logs and state management

**Security note**: Only use with trusted code like LLMunix.

### 3. Boot LLMunix

```bash
claude --dangerously-skip-permissions --verbose "boot llmunix"
```

You'll see the ASCII art welcome message confirming LLMunix is ready.

## üß™ Example Usage: Framework Execution

LLMunix can execute any type of project using the three-agent cognitive pipeline. Here are some examples:

### Example 1: Research and Development Projects

Execute complex research scenarios with autonomous agent coordination:

```bash
claude --dangerously-skip-permissions --verbose "llmunix execute: 'Research the latest developments in [your domain], create a comprehensive analysis, develop a formal framework, and implement a working prototype. Use the three-agent cognitive pipeline for complete end-to-end development.'"
```

### Example 2: Content Generation

Create professional content about your projects:

```bash
claude --dangerously-skip-permissions --verbose "llmunix execute: 'Create compelling content about [your project]. Develop a narrative that explains the innovation, the technical approach, and the potential impact. Make it engaging for both technical and non-technical audiences.'"
```

### Example 3: Project-Specific Execution

For specific projects in the `projects/` directory:

```bash
# Execute Project Aorta (biomedical quantum computing)
claude --dangerously-skip-permissions --verbose "llmunix execute: 'Run the Project Aorta scenario from projects/Project_aorta/'"

# Or any other project in the projects directory
claude --dangerously-skip-permissions --verbose "llmunix execute: 'Execute the project in projects/[project_name]/'"
```

## üîÑ Interactive Development Mode

For iterative development and refinement:

```bash
claude --dangerously-skip-permissions --verbose "./llmunix-llm interactive"
```

In interactive mode you can:
- Refine experiments with `refine` command
- Check execution status with `status`
- View history with `history`  
- Clear workspace with `clear`
- Get help with available commands

### Interactive Session Example:

```
üéØ llmunix> Run Project Aorta with enhanced quantum noise analysis
[Execution completes]

üéØ llmunix> refine
Previous goal: Run Project Aorta with enhanced quantum noise analysis
How would you like to refine this goal?
üîÑ refinement> Add error correction protocols and compare with classical performance metrics

üéØ llmunix> status
Workspace: /workspace/project_aorta/
Active agents: quantum-engineer-agent
Files created: 7
Memory entries: 3 experiences logged
```

## üèóÔ∏è How It Works: Pure Markdown Architecture

LLMunix uses a revolutionary pure markdown approach:

### Agent Definitions

All agents are defined as markdown files with YAML frontmatter:

```markdown
---
name: quantum-engineer-agent
description: Translates mathematical frameworks into executable Qiskit implementations
tools: Read, Write, Bash
---

# QuantumEngineerAgent
You are an expert quantum software engineer...
```

### Dynamic Component Creation

The SystemAgent can create new specialized agents during execution:

1. **Gap Analysis**: Identifies missing capabilities needed for task completion
2. **Agent Generation**: Creates new markdown agent definitions with proper YAML
3. **Runtime Integration**: Saves to `.claude/agents/` for immediate discovery
4. **Task Delegation**: Uses new agents via Claude Code's Task tool

### Memory-Driven Learning

Three-tier memory system enables continuous improvement:

- **Volatile Memory**: Temporary execution data
- **Task Memory**: Current goal context and decisions  
- **Permanent Memory**: Long-term patterns and successful strategies

## üß¨ Scientific Foundation

### Cardiovascular Physics

**Echo Formation**: Pressure waves reflect at arterial bifurcations due to impedance mismatches
- Geometric changes (one vessel ‚Üí two vessels)
- Vessel wall property differences
- Flow dynamics alterations

**Signal Model**: `s(t) = p(t) + Œ± * p(t - œÑ)`
- `p(t)`: Primary cardiac pressure pulse (~1-2 Hz)
- `Œ±`: Attenuation factor (0 < Œ± < 1)
- `œÑ`: Echo delay time (proportional to distance)

### Quantum Advantages

**Enhanced Resolution**: QFT provides superior frequency analysis for overlapping echoes
**Parallel Processing**: Quantum superposition enables simultaneous analysis
**Noise Resilience**: Quantum error correction improves signal-to-noise ratio
**Real-time Performance**: Faster processing for time-critical medical procedures

## üéØ Expected Results

### Technical Outcomes

- **Working Qiskit Implementation**: Complete quantum circuit for homomorphic analysis
- **Validation Results**: Comparison showing quantum vs classical echo detection accuracy
- **Performance Metrics**: Processing time, accuracy, and resource utilization
- **Medical Relevance**: Demonstration of radiation-free navigation feasibility

### Content Outcomes

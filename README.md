## üß¨ Project Aorta: Revolutionary Medical Navigation

Project Aorta recreates a university Electronics 4 bioengineering project that aimed to navigate arterial systems without X-ray radiation by analyzing pressure wave echoes from arterial bifurcations. This implementation enhances the original concept using quantum computing techniques.

### The Medical Innovation

**Problem**: Current catheter navigation relies on X-ray imaging, exposing patients and medical staff to radiation during procedures like angioplasty and stent placement.

**Solution**: A radiation-free navigation system using:
- **Catheter length measurement** and insertion point tracking
- **Pressure wave echo analysis** from arterial bifurcations  
- **Homomorphic signal processing** to detect echo delays
- **Anatomical mapping** to correlate echoes with vascular geometry
- **Real-time stenosis detection** for diagnostic capabilities

### Quantum Enhancement

The original classical cepstral analysis is enhanced with quantum computing:
- **Quantum Fourier Transform (QFT)** for enhanced frequency resolution
- **Quantum homomorphic processing** for superior echo separation  
- **Parallel processing** of multiple reflection components
- **Noise resilience** through quantum error correction

## üöÄ Quick Start Guide

### Prerequisites

- **[Claude Code](https://anthropic.com/claude-code)** installed on your system
- **Git** for repository cloning

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/EvolvingAgentsLabs/llmunix.git
cd llmunix
```

### 1. Initialize the System

**For Unix/Linux/Mac:**
```bash
./setup_agents.sh
```

**For Windows:**
```powershell
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\setup_agents.ps1
```

This copies agent definitions to `.claude/agents/` making them discoverable by Claude Code.

### 2. Understanding Permission Flags

LLMunix requires comprehensive file system access. Use the `--dangerously-skip-permissions` flag to avoid permission prompts:

```bash
# Recommended approach for LLMunix
claude --dangerously-skip-permissions --verbose "boot llmunix"
```

**Why use `--dangerously-skip-permissions`?**
- **Prevents interruptions**: No permission prompts during execution
- **Enables file operations**: Create workspace directories, agent files, and outputs
- **Supports agent evolution**: SystemAgent can create new specialized agents
- **Full functionality**: Access to all LLMunix capabilities

**What it enables:**
- Create and modify files in workspace directory
- Read and write to `.claude/agents/` directory
- Execute shell scripts and quantum simulations
- Access memory logs and state management

**Security note**: Only use with trusted code like LLMunix.

### 3. Boot LLMunix

```bash
claude --dangerously-skip-permissions --verbose "boot llmunix"
```

You'll see the ASCII art welcome message confirming LLMunix is ready.

## üèóÔ∏è How It Works: Pure Markdown Architecture

LLMunix uses a revolutionary pure markdown approach:

### Agent Definitions

All agents are defined as markdown files with YAML frontmatter:

```markdown
---
name: quantum-engineer-agent
description: Translates mathematical frameworks into executable Qiskit implementations
tools: Read, Write, Bash
---

# QuantumEngineerAgent
You are an expert quantum software engineer...
```

### Dynamic Component Creation

The SystemAgent can create new specialized agents during execution:

1. **Gap Analysis**: Identifies missing capabilities needed for task completion
2. **Agent Generation**: Creates new markdown agent definitions with proper YAML
3. **Runtime Integration**: Saves to `.claude/agents/` for immediate discovery
4. **Task Delegation**: Uses new agents via Claude Code's Task tool

### Memory-Driven Learning

Three-tier memory system enables continuous improvement:

- **Volatile Memory**: Temporary execution data
- **Task Memory**: Current goal context and decisions  
- **Permanent Memory**: Long-term patterns and successful strategies

## üß¨ Scientific Foundation

### Cardiovascular Physics

**Echo Formation**: Pressure waves reflect at arterial bifurcations due to impedance mismatches
- Geometric changes (one vessel ‚Üí two vessels)
- Vessel wall property differences
- Flow dynamics alterations

**Signal Model**: `s(t) = p(t) + Œ± * p(t - œÑ)`
- `p(t)`: Primary cardiac pressure pulse (~1-2 Hz)
- `Œ±`: Attenuation factor (0 < Œ± < 1)
- `œÑ`: Echo delay time (proportional to distance)

### Quantum Advantages

**Enhanced Resolution**: QFT provides superior frequency analysis for overlapping echoes
**Parallel Processing**: Quantum superposition enables simultaneous analysis
**Noise Resilience**: Quantum error correction improves signal-to-noise ratio
**Real-time Performance**: Faster processing for time-critical medical procedures

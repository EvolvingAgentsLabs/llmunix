## Usage Tips

1. **Start Simple**: Begin with basic execution commands before moving to complex workflows
2. **Use State Management**: For complex tasks, let LLMunix save state and resume if needed
3. **Leverage Memory**: Reference previous executions to build upon past learnings
4. **Mix Real & Simulation**: Use real execution for production work, simulation for training data
5. **Monitor Performance**: Track costs and execution time for optimization opportunities
6. **Build Libraries**: Save successful tool/agent definitions for reuse across projects

## Command Patterns

- `llmunix execute:` - Real-world execution with live tools
- `llmunix simulate:` - Training data generation mode  
- `Act as SystemAgent and [action]:` - Direct agent orchestration
- `boot llmunix` - System initialization
- State-aware commands automatically save/resume execution progress

Remember: LLMunix's power comes from treating everything as markdown-defined components that Claude interprets as a functional operating system. The system grows more capable as it learns from each execution.

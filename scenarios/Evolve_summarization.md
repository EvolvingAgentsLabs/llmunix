# Scenario: Evolve Summarization Agent

### Goal
The current SummarizationAgent outputs plain text summaries, but we need structured JSON output with separate 'title' and 'summary' fields for better integration with downstream systems. Evolve the SummarizationAgent by creating SummarizationAgent_v2.md with JSON output capability and update the SmartLibrary.md to point to the new version.

### Evolution Requirements

**Current Behavior**: SummarizationAgent_v1 outputs plain text summaries
**Desired Behavior**: SummarizationAgent_v2 outputs JSON with this structure:
```json
{
  "title": "Brief descriptive title (5-8 words)",
  "summary": "Concise summary paragraph"
}
```

### Test Input Data

**URL**: `https://www.ycombinator.com/about`

**Mock Content**: Use the existing Y Combinator content from the previous scenario to test the evolved component.

### Expected Deliverables
1. `components/agents/SummarizationAgent_v2.md` - The evolved component
2. Updated `system/SmartLibrary.md` - Pointing to v2 instead of v1
3. `summary_of_ycombinator_json.json` - JSON-formatted output file
4. Experience logged in SmartMemory showing successful evolution

### Success Criteria
- SystemAgent successfully identifies the need for component evolution
- Creates new component file with enhanced capabilities
- Updates library registry appropriately
- Demonstrates backwards compatibility planning
- Produces valid JSON output with title and summary fields

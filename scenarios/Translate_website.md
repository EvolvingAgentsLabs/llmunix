# Scenario: Translate Website Content

### Goal
Fetch the content of the website 'https://example.com', translate it to Spanish, and save the translation to a final output file named `translated_example_com.txt`.

### Input Data for Simulation

**URL**: `https://example.com`

**Mock Content for `https://example.com`**:
"""
Example Domain

"""

### Expected Challenge
This scenario requires a TranslationTool that does not exist in the current SmartLibrary, testing the SystemAgent's ability to handle missing components and either create new ones or gracefully fail with clear diagnostics.

# Scenario: Fine-Tuned LLM Simulation

## Goal

Demonstrate how a fine-tuned LLM would operate as an autonomous state machine agent, making external tool calls when needed to complete the Hugging Face research task, similar to how Claude Code operates.

## Objective

Show the target behavior for an LLM trained on AGI-OS execution traces by:
1. Simulating autonomous decision-making for external tool calls
2. Demonstrating context management across tool interactions
3. Showing state machine progression through workflow steps
4. Validating training data patterns through simulation

## Task Specification

**Primary Goal**: Simulate a fine-tuned LLM completing the Hugging Face research task autonomously

**Target Behavior**:
- LLM analyzes current context and goal
- Identifies information gaps requiring external data
- Generates structured tool requests (WebFetch, Read, Write)
- Processes tool results and updates context
- Continues workflow until completion

**Deliverables**:
1. `workspace/simulation_log.md` - Decision-making trace
2. `workspace/tool_requests.json` - Generated tool calls
3. `workspace/context_evolution.md` - Context changes over time
4. `workspace/simulation_metrics.json` - Performance validation

## Simulation Workflow

### Phase 1: Initial Context Assessment
**Simulated LLM Reasoning**:
```
Current Context: Goal to research Hugging Face AI developments
Available Info: Goal description only
Information Gap: No current data about Hugging Face blog content
Decision: Need external data acquisition
```

**Expected Tool Request**:
```json
{
  "action": "TOOL_REQUEST",
  "tool_name": "WebFetch", 
  "reasoning": "Goal requires current AI developments from Hugging Face blog, but no recent data in context",
  "parameters": {
    "url": "https://huggingface.co/blog",
    "prompt": "Extract recent AI research, model announcements, and technical developments"
  },
  "expected_outcome": "Live blog content with current AI developments for analysis"
}
```

### Phase 2: Content Processing Decision
**Simulated LLM Reasoning**:
```
Current Context: Raw blog content available
Available Info: Unstructured web content
Information Gap: Need structured analysis of content
Decision: Process available information (no external call needed)
```

**Expected Processing Result**:
```json
{
  "action": "PROCESSING_RESULT",
  "content": {
    "analysis": "Structured summary of Hugging Face developments",
    "key_insights": ["transformer improvements", "new model releases", "platform updates"],
    "confidence": 0.93
  },
  "completion_status": "CONTINUE"
}
```

### Phase 3: Report Generation Decision
**Simulated LLM Reasoning**:
```
Current Context: Structured analysis complete
Available Info: Summary and insights
Information Gap: Need to persist results as deliverable
Decision: Require file write operation
```

**Expected Tool Request**:
```json
{
  "action": "TOOL_REQUEST",
  "tool_name": "Write",
  "reasoning": "Analysis complete, need to create final research report file",
  "parameters": {
    "file_path": "workspace/huggingface_research_report.md",
    "content": "# Hugging Face AI Research Report\n\n[Formatted report content]"
  },
  "expected_outcome": "Research report persisted as deliverable file"
}
```

### Phase 4: Completion Assessment
**Simulated LLM Reasoning**:
```
Current Context: Report generated and saved
Available Info: Complete workflow execution trace
Information Gap: None - goal achieved
Decision: Mark task as complete
```

**Expected Processing Result**:
```json
{
  "action": "PROCESSING_RESULT",
  "content": {
    "status": "TASK_COMPLETE",
    "summary": "Successfully researched Hugging Face developments and created report",
    "deliverables": ["workspace/huggingface_research_report.md"],
    "confidence": 0.97
  },
  "completion_status": "COMPLETE"
}
```

## Simulation Validation Criteria

### Decision Accuracy
- **Tool Selection**: Chooses correct tool for each information gap
- **Parameter Quality**: Provides appropriate parameters for tool calls
- **Context Usage**: Effectively utilizes available information

### State Management
- **Progression Logic**: Follows logical workflow steps
- **Context Integration**: Properly incorporates tool results
- **Completion Detection**: Recognizes when goal is achieved

### Autonomous Operation
- **No Human Intervention**: Makes all decisions independently
- **Error Recovery**: Handles potential tool failures gracefully
- **Reasoning Transparency**: Provides clear decision explanations

## Training Data Patterns Demonstrated

### Pattern 1: Information Gap → Tool Request
```
IF (goal requires data X) AND (data X not in context)
THEN generate tool_request for acquiring data X
```

### Pattern 2: Sufficient Context → Processing
```
IF (goal requires processing Y) AND (all needed data available)
THEN generate processing_result for Y
```

### Pattern 3: Results → Persistence
```
IF (processing complete) AND (results need saving)
THEN generate tool_request for file write
```

### Pattern 4: Goal Achievement → Completion
```
IF (all deliverables created) AND (goal satisfied)
THEN mark task as complete
```

## Expected Performance Metrics

### Simulation Success Criteria
- **Decision Points**: 4 major decision points handled correctly
- **Tool Requests**: 2-3 well-formed external tool calls
- **Processing Results**: 2-3 direct processing actions
- **Goal Achievement**: Complete research report generated
- **Autonomy Level**: 100% autonomous decision-making

### Quality Metrics
- **Reasoning Quality**: Clear explanations for each decision
- **Tool Request Accuracy**: Appropriate tools selected for information gaps
- **Context Management**: Effective integration of external data
- **Output Quality**: Professional research report generated

## Implementation Notes

This simulation demonstrates the **target architecture** for a fine-tuned LLM:

1. **State Machine Operation**: LLM operates as deterministic state machine
2. **External Tool Integration**: Makes structured requests for external data
3. **Context Management**: Maintains and updates working context across calls
4. **Autonomous Decision Making**: Decides when external calls are needed
5. **Goal-Oriented Execution**: Continues until objective is achieved

The simulation validates that training data from AGI-OS contains the patterns needed to teach an LLM this autonomous, tool-calling behavior.

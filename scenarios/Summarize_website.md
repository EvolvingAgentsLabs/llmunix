About Y Combinator

Y Combinator is a startup accelerator that has helped launch over 4,000 companies, including Airbnb, Dropbox, Stripe, Reddit, Discord, DoorDash, Coinbase, Instacart, and many others. Since 2005, we've funded startups in batches twice a year.

Our program is 3 months long, and we work intensively with the companies in our batch to help them get in the best possible shape and refine their pitch to investors. Each batch culminates in Demo Day, where the startups present their companies to a carefully selected, invite-only audience of investors.

In addition to the core accelerator program, Y Combinator runs several other programs:

- YC Growth: a program for later-stage companies
- YC Continuity: our growth-stage investment fund  
- Startup School: a free online course for entrepreneurs
- Work at a Startup: our job board connecting job seekers with YC companies

Y Combinator's mission is to help startups succeed. We believe that technology companies have enormous potential to improve the world, and we want to help the most promising startups reach their full potential.

We invest $500,000 in every company we fund. In exchange, we take 7% equity. But we think the value we provide goes far beyond the money. The YC network is powerful â€“ our alumni companies help each other in ways that range from sharing technical knowledge to making introductions to potential customers, partners, and employees.

Our partners include some of the most successful entrepreneurs and investors in Silicon Valley. They provide mentorship, connections, and expertise to help our startups succeed.

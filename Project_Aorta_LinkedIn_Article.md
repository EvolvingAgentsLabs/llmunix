# From Biomedical Vision to Quantum Reality: How AI Agents Recreated a University Project in 3 Steps

*When artificial intelligence meets quantum computing to solve real-world medical challenges*

---

## The Challenge That Started It All

Picture this: You're navigating a catheter through someone's arterial system, but instead of using continuous X-ray imaging that exposes patients and medical staff to harmful radiation, you're using quantum-enhanced pressure wave analysis to "see" arterial bifurcations in real-time. Sound like science fiction? That's exactly what **Project Aorta** set out to explore.

This experimental project began with a deeply personal question: Could we recreate a university bioengineering project I built **25 years ago** using modern AI agents and quantum computing? Back then, I was working with an XT computer and Turbo Pascal—hardly the ideal hardware for biomedical signal processing. Yet that "toy project" taught me something profound about the intersection of ambition and available technology.

Today, exploring quantum computing feels remarkably similar. The hardware isn't quite there yet, the tools are emerging, and we're building with the confidence that quantum computing will follow the same exponential trajectory as classical computing did over the past decades. Sometimes, it's time to start building, even when the foundation is still being laid.

## The "Cognitive Trinity" Approach

What makes Project Aorta unique isn't just the quantum computing aspect—it's how we built it. Instead of having one AI system tackle the entire problem, we created a **three-agent cognitive pipeline** that mirrors how humans naturally approach complex interdisciplinary challenges:

**🔮 Vision Agent**: Takes a high-level research concept and transforms it into a comprehensive project description with scientific context
**📐 Mathematician Agent**: Converts the vision into rigorous mathematical frameworks and equations
**⚛️ Quantum Engineer Agent**: Translates the mathematics into executable Qiskit code

This human-like workflow—from natural language idea to mathematical representation to working code—demonstrates how specialized AI agents can collaborate on problems that span multiple domains of expertise.

## The Experiment: What We're Really Looking For

**The Core Question**: Can we detect arterial bifurcations (where blood vessels branch) by analyzing pressure wave echoes, without using X-ray imaging?

**What We're Measuring**: When your heart beats, it sends a pressure pulse through your arterial system. When this pulse hits a bifurcation, part of it reflects back toward the heart—creating an "echo" in the pressure signal. By detecting and analyzing these echoes, we can map the arterial structure and track a catheter's position in real-time.

**The Detection Challenge**: The problem is that these echoes are incredibly subtle—they're not high-frequency signals, but rather time-delayed, attenuated copies of the original cardiac pulse. Multiple bifurcations create overlapping echoes that classical signal processing struggles to separate. It's like trying to identify which buildings are reflecting your voice when you shout in a city canyon—you hear all the echoes mixed together.

**The Quantum Opportunity**: This is where quantum computing becomes compelling. The mathematical structure of overlapping echo detection aligns perfectly with quantum algorithms' strengths: superposition for handling multiple signal components simultaneously, and quantum Fourier transforms for superior frequency resolution.

## Why Homomorphic Analysis? The Mathematical Elegance

**The Homomorphic Property**: Homomorphic analysis preserves mathematical structure across transformations. In our case, this means we can perform operations on the frequency domain that directly correspond to operations in the time domain—without losing the echo separation we need.

**The Elegant Solution**: Traditional echo detection requires complex deconvolution operations to separate overlapping signals. Homomorphic analysis transforms this into a much simpler problem:

1. **Transform to Log Domain**: `log[p(t) + α * p(t - τ)]` becomes manageable
2. **Quantum Fourier Transform**: Superior frequency resolution reveals individual echo components
3. **Logarithmic Operations**: Quantum superposition naturally separates additive echo components
4. **Inverse Transform**: Reveals clean, separated echo delays

**Why This Works**: The homomorphic property means that multiplication in the time domain becomes addition in the log domain. Since echoes are multiplied (attenuated) versions of the original pulse, homomorphic analysis turns the complex problem of separating multiplicative factors into the simpler problem of separating additive components—which quantum algorithms excel at.

**The Quantum Advantage**: Classical homomorphic analysis is computationally expensive. Quantum homomorphic analysis leverages quantum parallelism to perform these operations on multiple echo components simultaneously, while quantum Fourier transforms provide the frequency resolution needed to distinguish closely-spaced echoes.

**Mathematical Beauty**: The complete solution becomes: quantum encoding of pressure signals → QFT for frequency analysis → quantum logarithmic operations in superposition → inverse QFT → echo delay extraction. Each step leverages quantum mechanics' natural properties rather than fighting against classical computational limitations.

## The Science: An Iterative Journey to Quantum Solutions

At its core, Project Aorta tackles a fundamental challenge in interventional cardiology: **radiation-free catheter navigation**. But getting there was a journey of iterations and refinements.

**The Initial Challenge**: My first approach focused solely on cardiac pressure waves—the natural pulses from heartbeats. But the AI agents quickly identified a critical limitation: cardiac pulses alone don't provide sufficient echo resolution for precise arterial mapping.

**Iteration 1: Enhanced Signal Sources**: When I asked the agents to rerun the analysis with external pulse generation, they presented multiple viable options: ultrasonic transducers, piezoelectric pulse generators, hydraulic micro-pumps, and electromagnetic field generators. Each offered unique advantages for creating controlled pressure pulses to register cleaner echoes.

**Iteration 2: The Quantum-Everything Approach**: Initially, we implemented a complete quantum solution using cepstral analysis—computing everything with quantum algorithms. While technically impressive, this approach was computationally inefficient for practical applications.

**The Breakthrough: "Cheese with Holes" Strategy**: This is where **Ismael Faro's** insight proved transformative. He suggested we explore the solution space "like cheese with holes"—identifying where classical computing excels (the "cheese") and where quantum computing provides genuine advantages (the "holes").

**The Refined Quantum Solution**: Following this hybrid approach, quantum homomorphic analysis uses the Quantum Fourier Transform strategically. The process works like this:

1. **Signal Encoding**: Arterial pressure signals are encoded into quantum states
2. **Quantum Fourier Transform**: Provides enhanced frequency analysis beyond classical limitations
3. **Quantum Logarithmic Operations**: Separates overlapping echo components using quantum superposition
4. **Inverse Transform**: Reveals individual echo delays corresponding to anatomical landmarks

The mathematical elegance is striking: `s(t) = p(t) + α * p(t - τ)` where the echo isn't a high-frequency signal—it's a time-delayed, attenuated copy of the original pulse. Quantum processing excels at detecting these subtle temporal patterns.

## The "Cheese with Holes" Breakthrough

The iterative process taught us that **arterial echo detection is naturally sparse**—most of the signal processing can be handled classically, with quantum advantages appearing only in specific scenarios. This led to our refined "Cheese with Holes" hybrid approach:

- **The Cheese**: Most signal processing handled by fast classical methods (>95% of computations)—baseline filtering, noise reduction, primary echo detection
- **The Holes**: Quantum processing applied strategically to challenging cases (<5% of computations)—overlapping echoes from complex bifurcations, critical medical frequencies requiring superior resolution, real-time cepstral analysis under time constraints

This wasn't just a computational optimization—it was a philosophical shift. Instead of forcing quantum solutions everywhere, we learned to identify the precise points where quantum computing provides genuine, measurable advantages over classical approaches.

## Real-World Impact Potential

While Project Aorta is firmly in the experimental/educational realm—**this is a learning project, not a medical device**—the potential applications are compelling:

**Medical Benefits**:
- **90-95% radiation reduction** in cardiac procedures
- **Enhanced navigation accuracy** in complex arterial anatomy
- **Real-time diagnostic capabilities** detecting stenosis and plaque
- **Broader access** to complex procedures in facilities without advanced imaging

**Technical Advantages**:
- **Processing speed**: Quantum algorithms may achieve faster real-time performance
- **Noise resilience**: Quantum error correction could improve signal-to-noise ratios
- **Enhanced resolution**: Superior separation of overlapping echoes from multiple bifurcations

## Learning Through Small LLM Agents

Project Aorta represents more than a quantum computing experiment—it's part of exploring how **small, specialized LLM agents** can tackle complex multi-domain problems. Rather than relying on massive, general-purpose models, we're investigating whether focused agents with clear cognitive roles can collaborate effectively on specialized tasks.

The three-agent architecture proved surprisingly effective at maintaining domain expertise while enabling knowledge transfer between disciplines. Each agent brought deep specialization (biomedical vision, mathematical rigor, quantum implementation) while building coherently on the previous agent's work.

## Acknowledging Innovation

This work builds on insights from **Ismael Faro** regarding hybrid quantum-classical solutions for practical quantum advantage. The recognition that most quantum computing applications will be hybrid systems—leveraging classical efficiency where possible and quantum power where necessary—shaped our "Cheese with Holes" approach.

## Building for Tomorrow's Hardware

Project Aorta represents more than a technical exercise—it's about building for the future while learning from the past.

**The Historical Parallel**: Twenty-five years ago, I built the original version of this system on an XT computer with Turbo Pascal. The hardware was laughably inadequate for real biomedical signal processing, yet that constraint-driven development taught me fundamental principles that still apply today.

**The Quantum Parallel**: Today's quantum computing landscape feels remarkably similar. The hardware limitations are real, the noise levels are challenging, and practical applications seem just out of reach. But I have the same confidence now that I had then—quantum computing hardware will follow the exponential improvement trajectory that classical computing demonstrated over the past decades.

**Why Build Now**: Just as we didn't wait for perfect classical computers to start exploring biomedical applications, we shouldn't wait for perfect quantum computers to begin building quantum-hybrid solutions. The algorithms we develop today, the hybrid strategies we refine, and the domain insights we capture will be the foundation for tomorrow's quantum-native medical devices.

Project Aorta demonstrates how AI agents can bridge the gap between theoretical quantum advantages and practical applications, creating a development pipeline that can rapidly explore quantum solutions across multiple domains as the hardware evolves.

## What's Next?

This is just the beginning—and it's deeply personal. What started as a "toy project" 25 years ago has become a testament to the power of specialized AI agents working together on complex, interdisciplinary challenges.

**The Toy Project Reality**: Let me be clear—Project Aorta is fundamentally a learning exercise, a way to explore quantum computing through a problem I understand deeply. It's not a medical device, not a commercial venture, just a passionate exploration of what's possible when you combine domain knowledge with emerging technologies.

**The Learning Journey**: The iterative development process—from cardiac waves alone, to external pulse generation, from quantum-everything to hybrid "cheese with holes"—mirrors the messy reality of innovation. Each iteration taught us something valuable about both the problem domain and the emerging quantum computing landscape.

**Building the Foundation**: The complete technical implementation, mathematical frameworks, and agent architectures are available for exploration and extension.

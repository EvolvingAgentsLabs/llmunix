# Planning Phase: Chaos & Bifurcation Tutorial

## Goal Analysis

**User Request:**
"Create a new version of tutorial to explain chaos and bifurcation in discrete prey-predator model. Create the Tutorial and a sample python script to explain it with code, and mathematical foundations"

**Decomposition:**
1. Mathematical foundations (rigorous theory)
2. Educational tutorial (integrated explanation)
3. Python implementation (executable code with visualizations)

## Agent Architecture Decision

### Multi-Agent Pattern Selected
**Rationale:** This task requires three distinct areas of expertise that benefit from specialized agents:

1. **MathematicalFoundationsAgent**
   - Domain: Advanced mathematics, dynamical systems
   - Responsibility: Provide rigorous mathematical formulations
   - Output: Mathematical specifications for tutorial and code

2. **TutorialWriterAgent**
   - Domain: Educational content creation
   - Responsibility: Integrate mathematics and code into pedagogical tutorial
   - Output: Comprehensive tutorial document

3. **PythonCodeGeneratorAgent**
   - Domain: Scientific computing
   - Responsibility: Implement simulations and visualizations
   - Output: Complete Python script with examples

### Coordination Pattern
```
SystemAgent (orchestrator)
    ↓
    ├→ MathematicalFoundationsAgent
    │  └→ Produces: Mathematical specifications
    │
    ├→ PythonCodeGeneratorAgent
    │  ├→ Receives: Math specs from MathematicalFoundationsAgent
    │  └→ Produces: Python implementation
    │
    └→ TutorialWriterAgent
       ├→ Receives: Math content from MathematicalFoundationsAgent
       ├→ Receives: Code from PythonCodeGeneratorAgent
       └→ Produces: Integrated tutorial
```

## Why This Architecture?

### Advantages of Multi-Agent Approach:
1. **Specialization:** Each agent focuses on what it does best
2. **Modularity:** Components can be reused for similar projects
3. **Quality:** Depth in each domain (math, writing, code)
4. **Maintainability:** Changes to one aspect don't affect others
5. **Transparency:** Clear responsibilities and data flow

### Alternative Considered:
**Monolithic approach** (single agent does everything)
- ❌ Lacks depth in each domain
- ❌ Harder to maintain and debug
- ❌ Not reusable for other projects
- ❌ Unclear separation of concerns

## Execution Plan

### Phase 1: Mathematical Foundations
- Invoke MathematicalFoundationsAgent
- Generate complete mathematical specifications
- Log to memory/short_term/

### Phase 2: Code Implementation
- Invoke PythonCodeGeneratorAgent
- Implement based on mathematical specifications
- Generate visualizations
- Log to memory/short_term/

### Phase 3: Tutorial Integration
- Invoke TutorialWriterAgent
- Integrate mathematics and code
- Create educational narrative
- Log to memory/short_term/

### Phase 4: Consolidation
- Review all outputs
- Consolidate learnings to memory/long_term/
- Document patterns and insights

## Success Criteria

✓ **Mathematical rigor:** All derivations correct and complete
✓ **Code quality:** Executable, well-documented, produces correct results
✓ **Tutorial quality:** Clear, pedagogical, integrates theory and practice

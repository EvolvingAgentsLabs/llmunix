# Agent Interaction Log: Mathematician Agent

## Request
Formalize comprehensive mathematical framework for echo-based arterial navigation, building on the vision document created by visionary-agent.

## Agent Task Details
**Delegated to:** mathematician-agent (general-purpose agent)

**Objective:** Create rigorous mathematical formalization covering:
- Signal model: s(t) = p(t) + α * p(t - τ)
- Frequency domain analysis: S(ω) = P(ω) * (1 + α * e^(-iωτ))
- Homomorphic decomposition: log|S(ω)| separation
- Cepstral peak detection for echo delay identification
- Inverse problem formulation for position estimation
- Quantum algorithm mathematics (preliminary)

**Input Document:** projects/Project_aorta/output/project_vision.md

## Agent Response Summary
Successfully created comprehensive 1000-line mathematical framework document covering:

1. **Signal Model Formalization (Section 1)**
   - Single echo: s(t) = p(t) + α · p(t - τ)
   - Multi-echo extension: s(t) = p(t) + Σᵢ αᵢ · p(t - τᵢ)
   - Convolution representation: s(t) = p(t) * h(t)
   - Physical parameter constraints (α: 0.1-0.5, τ: 2-250 ms)
   - Moens-Korteweg equation for PWV
   - Rigorous assumptions and validity conditions

2. **Frequency Domain Analysis (Section 2)**
   - Transfer function: H(ω) = 1 + Σᵢ αᵢ · e^(-iωτᵢ)
   - Magnitude spectrum: |H(ω)| with periodic notches
   - Phase spectrum: ∠H(ω)
   - Spectral notch frequency: fₙₒₜ꜀ₕ = (2k+1)π/τ
   - Multi-echo interference patterns

3. **Homomorphic Decomposition (Section 3)**
   - Logarithmic transformation: log S(ω) = log P(ω) + log H(ω)
   - Cepstral analysis: c(τ) = ℱ⁻¹{log S(ω)}
   - Theorem: Cepstral peaks at quefrencies τᵢ with heights ∝ αᵢ
   - Complete peak detection algorithm (6 steps)
   - Distance estimation: dᵢ = (PWV · τᵢ)/2
   - Error analysis: σₐ ~ 2-5 mm

4. **Inverse Problem Formulation (Section 4)**
   - Position estimation as optimization: x̂ = argmin E(x)
   - Objective function: E(x) = Σᵢ [τᵢᵐ - τᵢᵖʳᵉᵈ(x)]²
   - Anatomical constraints: x ∈ G (vascular lumen)
   - Temporal smoothness regularization
   - Search space: K ~ 10⁴-10⁵ candidate positions
   - Computational complexity: Classical O(K·N), Quantum O(√K·N)
   - Speedup factor: ~400× for K=10⁵

5. **Quantum Algorithm Mathematics (Section 5)**
   - State preparation: |ψ₀⟩ = (1/√K) Σₓ |x⟩
   - Quantum Fourier Transform: QFT with O((log N)²) complexity
   - Quantum oracle for position scoring: f(x) = exp(-E(x)/σ²)
   - Grover amplitude amplification: ~√K iterations
   - Measurement and classical readout
   - Speedup analysis: ~1.27√K ≈ 400× for K=10⁵

6. **Numerical Examples (Section 6)**

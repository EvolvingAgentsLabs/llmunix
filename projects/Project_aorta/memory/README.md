## Memory Categories

### 1. Learned Patterns (`learned_patterns.yaml`)
Consolidated patterns of successful agent interactions:

- **Agent Sequencing**: Optimal order for agent involvement
- **Handoff Strategies**: Effective knowledge transfer methods
- **Communication Timing**: When agents should interact vs. work independently
- **Error Recovery**: Proven strategies for handling failures
- **Parallel vs Sequential**: When to use concurrent vs. sequential processing

### 2. Agent Collaboration Map (`agent_collaboration_map.yaml`)
Knowledge about which agent combinations work best:

- **High-Performance Pairs**: Agent combinations with proven success rates
- **Synergistic Triads**: Three-agent configurations that amplify results
- **Complementary Skills**: How different agent capabilities reinforce each other
- **Conflict Resolution**: Strategies for resolving agent disagreements
- **Load Balancing**: Optimal work distribution across agents

### 3. Knowledge Discoveries (`knowledge_discoveries.md`)
Domain-specific insights accumulated across sessions:

- **Biomedical Quantum Computing Insights**: Technical breakthroughs and learnings
- **Mathematical Framework Patterns**: Recurring mathematical structures and approaches
- **Implementation Strategies**: Software engineering patterns that work well
- **Cross-Domain Connections**: Unexpected links between different knowledge areas
- **Creative Problem-Solving**: Novel approaches that emerged from agent collaboration

### 4. Communication Templates (`communication_templates.yaml`)
Proven formats and patterns for agent communication:

- **Request Templates**: Effective ways to delegate tasks to specific agents
- **Response Formats**: Structured ways for agents to return results
- **Status Updates**: Patterns for keeping other agents informed
- **Error Reports**: Clear ways to communicate failures and needed help
- **Knowledge Sharing**: Formats for transferring complex information between agents

### 5. Performance Baselines (`performance_baselines.yaml`)
Metrics and benchmarks for continuous improvement:

- **Task Completion Times**: Average and best execution times by task type
- **Success Rates**: Completion rates for different agent combinations
- **Quality Metrics**: Measures of output quality for various approaches
- **Resource Usage**: Computational and memory efficiency patterns
- **User Satisfaction**: Feedback patterns and preference learning

## Memory Consolidation Process

### Input Sources
- **Volatile Traces**: Raw communication logs from workspace/memory/traces/
- **Execution Results**: Actual outcomes and deliverables from sessions
- **Performance Data**: Timing, resource usage, and success metrics
- **User Feedback**: Quality assessments and preference indicators

### Consolidation Pipeline
1. **Pattern Recognition**: Identify recurring successful strategies
2. **Statistical Analysis**: Quantify performance patterns and trends
3. **Knowledge Synthesis**: Combine insights from multiple sessions
4. **Template Extraction**: Create reusable communication and process templates
5. **Baseline Updates**: Refresh performance benchmarks with new data

### Quality Assurance
- **Validation**: Test learned patterns on historical data
- **Contradiction Detection**: Identify and resolve conflicting patterns
- **Relevance Scoring**: Prioritize patterns by frequency and success rate
- **Decay Management**: Fade outdated patterns in favor of recent learnings

## Usage by LLMunix System

### Query-Driven Access
The QueryMemoryTool and MemoryAnalysisAgent use this long-term memory to:

- **Agent Selection**: Choose optimal agents based on historical performance
- **Communication Optimization**: Use proven templates for agent interactions
- **Strategy Selection**: Apply successful patterns to new but similar tasks
- **Risk Assessment**: Identify potential issues based on past experiences
- **Quality Prediction**: Estimate likely outcomes based on historical patterns

### Continuous Learning
Each new session contributes to long-term memory:

- **Pattern Reinforcement**: Successful strategies get stronger weightings
- **Discovery Integration**: New insights expand the knowledge base
- **Adaptation**: Patterns evolve based on changing conditions and requirements
- **Cross-Pollination**: Insights from Project Aorta inform other projects

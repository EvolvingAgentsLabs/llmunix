# Belief Network Agent

## Purpose
The BeliefNetworkAgent maintains a coherent network of beliefs about the world state, updating beliefs based on new information and resolving contradictions through logical reasoning.

## Core Capabilities
- **Belief Representation**: Store structured beliefs in markdown
- **Consistency Checking**: Detect and resolve contradictions
- **Belief Updating**: Incorporate new information
- **Uncertainty Handling**: Manage belief confidence levels

## Belief Structure
```yaml
belief_id: string
content: string
confidence: number  # 0-100
sources: [list of evidence IDs]
dependencies: [list of related belief IDs]
last_updated: ISO timestamp
contradictions: [list of contradicting belief IDs]
status: "active" | "deprecated" | "uncertain"
```

## Operations
1. **Belief Addition**: Add new beliefs from observations
2. **Belief Updating**: Update existing beliefs with new evidence
3. **Contradiction Resolution**: Resolve conflicts between beliefs
4. **Belief Querying**: Retrieve beliefs based on criteria

## Integration Points
- Called during planning to provide belief context
- Updated after each execution step with new information
- Consulted when making decisions requiring world state

## Implementation Pattern
```markdown
Action: Read workspace/state/beliefs.md
Observation: [Current belief network]

Action: Process new information and update beliefs
Observation: [Updated belief network with consistency checks]

Action: Write workspace/state/beliefs.md
Observation: [Updated belief file stored]
```

## Tree-Based Belief Management
Inspired by Sakana AI's tree search approach, the BeliefNetworkAgent implements:

1. **Belief Trees**: Hierarchical organization of beliefs with parent-child relationships
2. **Alternative Hypotheses**: Multiple competing beliefs maintained with confidence scores
3. **Evidence-Based Evaluation**: Beliefs evaluated based on supporting evidence
4. **Systematic Exploration**: Unexplored belief implications are systematically investigated

## Advanced Belief Operations

### Belief Consistency Checking
```markdown
Action: Identify potential contradictions in belief network
Observation: [List of contradicting belief pairs]

Action: For each contradiction:
  1. Evaluate evidence strength for each belief
  2. Calculate confidence adjustment based on evidence
  3. Update status of lower-confidence beliefs
  4. Log reasoning for future reference
Observation: [Consistency restoration complete]
```

### Belief Integration
```markdown
Action: Receive new observation
Observation: [New information details]

Action: Compare with existing beliefs
Observation: [Related beliefs identified]

Action: Calculate belief updates
  1. For confirming evidence: Increase confidence
  2. For contradicting evidence: Trigger consistency check
  3. For novel information: Create new belief
Observation: [Belief updates determined]

Action: Apply updates to belief network
Observation: [Belief network updated]
```

## Specialized Capabilities

### Context-Aware Decision Support
The BeliefNetworkAgent provides context for decision-making by:
1. Identifying relevant beliefs for a given task
2. Assessing confidence in critical assumptions
3. Highlighting potential knowledge gaps
4. Suggesting belief verification actions

### Learning From Execution
After task execution, the agent:
1. Compares expected outcomes (beliefs) with actual results
2. Updates belief confidence based on prediction accuracy
3. Identifies systematic belief biases
4. Refines belief formation processes

### Memory Integration
The BeliefNetworkAgent works with the memory system by:
1. Converting episodic memories into semantic beliefs
2. Attaching confidence scores to memory-derived beliefs
3. Using memory patterns to validate belief consistency
4. Creating a coherent world model from fragmented experiences

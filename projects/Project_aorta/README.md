## üß¨ Project Overview: Revolutionary Medical Navigation

Project Aorta recreates a university Electronics 4 bioengineering project that aimed to navigate arterial systems without X-ray radiation by analyzing pressure wave echoes from arterial bifurcations. This implementation enhances the original concept using quantum computing techniques.

### The Medical Innovation

**Problem**: Current catheter navigation relies on X-ray imaging, exposing patients and medical staff to radiation during procedures like angioplasty and stent placement.

**Solution**: A radiation-free navigation system using:
- **Catheter length measurement** and insertion point tracking
- **Pressure wave echo analysis** from arterial bifurcations
- **Homomorphic signal processing** to detect echo delays
- **Anatomical mapping** to correlate echoes with vascular geometry
- **Real-time stenosis detection** for diagnostic capabilities

### Quantum Enhancement

The original classical cepstral analysis is enhanced with quantum computing:
- **Quantum Fourier Transform (QFT)** for enhanced frequency resolution
- **Quantum homomorphic processing** for superior echo separation
- **Parallel processing** of multiple reflection components
- **Noise resilience** through quantum error correction

# Projects Directory

This directory will contain your LLMunix projects, each with its own:
- components/ (agents and tools)
- input/ (source documents)
- output/ (generated results)
- memory/ (short_term and long_term learning)
- workspace/ (execution state)

Projects are created automatically when you execute goals with LLMunix.

Example project structure:
```
projects/Project_example/
├── components/
│   ├── agents/          # Project-specific agents
│   └── tools/           # Project-specific tools
├── input/               # Input documents
├── output/              # Generated outputs
├── memory/              # Learning and memory
│   ├── short_term/      # High-frequency memory
│   └── long_term/       # Consolidated patterns
└── workspace/           # Execution state
    └── state/           # Plan, context, variables, etc.
```

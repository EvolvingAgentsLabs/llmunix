# Agent Interaction Log: Visionary Agent (Seismic Surveying)

## Memory-Driven Execution

**Strategy:** Applied proven patterns from Project Aorta memory to new domain (seismic surveying)

**Memory Insights Used:**
- Three-agent pipeline template (vision → math → code)

- Target length: 700-800 lines (Aorta was 768 lines)
- Quantitative targets essential for downstream agents
- Deployment roadmap provides actionable next steps

## Request

Create comprehensive project vision for quantum-enhanced seismic surveying using homomorphic analysis of seismic wave echoes in geological strata.

**Domain Adaptation:**
- From: Pressure wave echoes in arterial blood flow
- To: Seismic wave echoes in geological layers

## Agent Task Details

**Delegated to:** visionary-agent (general-purpose agent)

**Inputs:**

# Dynamic Component Creation Test

## Goal
"Analyze the sentiment and key topics from 3 different tech news websites, then create a comparative report showing which sources are most positive about AI developments"

## Why This Tests Dynamic Creation

This goal requires capabilities that don't exist in the current SmartLibrary:

1. **Sentiment Analysis** - No existing sentiment analysis tool
2. **Multi-source Comparison** - No existing comparative analysis agent  
3. **Topic Extraction** - Need to extract and compare topics across sources

## Expected Component Creation During Execution

The LLM interpreter should:

1. **Recognize Missing Capabilities**: SystemAgent reads SmartLibrary.md and realizes no sentiment analysis or comparative analysis tools exist

2. **Create SentimentAnalysisTool.md**: Based on the goal requirements, create a tool that can analyze sentiment in text

3. **Create ComparativeAnalysisAgent.md**: Create an agent that can compare multiple sources and generate reports

4. **Update SmartLibrary.md**: Register the new components so they can be used

5. **Execute with New Components**: Use the newly created components to complete the goal

## Test Execution Command

```bash
python3 llm_interpreter.py execute "Analyze the sentiment and key topics from 3 different tech news websites (TechCrunch AI, Reuters Technology, BBC Technology), then create a comparative report showing which sources are most positive about AI developments"
```

## Success Criteria

### Technical Success:
- [ ] SystemAgent identifies missing capabilities by consulting SmartLibrary.md
- [ ] New markdown component files are created in components/ directory
- [ ] SmartLibrary.md is updated with new component entries
- [ ] Components are successfully used in execution

### Functional Success:
- [ ] Fetches content from 3 news sources using existing RealWebFetchTool
- [ ] Analyzes sentiment using newly created SentimentAnalysisTool
- [ ] Generates comparative report using newly created ComparativeAnalysisAgent
- [ ] Produces final report showing sentiment comparison

## What This Proves

This test will prove that:

1. **Pure Markdown Framework**: The system truly operates through markdown specifications without hardcoded logic
2. **Dynamic Component Creation**: New capabilities can be created during runtime based on user goals
3. **Self-Evolving System**: The system can expand its own capabilities as needed
4. **LLM Interpreter Integration**: The interpreter correctly delegates to SystemAgent for component creation

## Expected File Structure After Execution

```
components/
├── tools/
│   ├── [existing tools]
│   └── SentimentAnalysisTool.md        # Created during execution
└── agents/
    ├── [existing agents]

└── [other system files]

├── sentiment_analysis/                 # Sentiment results
└── comparative_report.md               # Final output
```

This test validates the core LLMunix principle: everything emerges from Claude interpreting markdown documents, with no hardcoded component logic.

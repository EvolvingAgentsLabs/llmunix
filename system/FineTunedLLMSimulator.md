# Fine-Tuned LLM Simulator

This component simulates how a fine-tuned LLM would operate as a state machine after being trained on AGI-OS execution traces. The simulation demonstrates the target behavior where the LLM can autonomously request external tool calls when needed.

## Simulation Architecture

### Core Concept
The fine-tuned LLM operates as a **state machine** that:
1. Processes current context and state
2. Determines if external information is needed
3. Requests specific tool calls via structured output
4. Integrates tool results into context
5. Continues workflow execution
6. Repeats until goal completion

### State Machine Flow
```
Current Context → Reasoning → Decision Point:
├── Has Sufficient Info? → Continue Processing → Output
└── Needs External Data? → Request Tool Call → Wait for Results → Continue
```

## Simulation Protocol

### Input Format
The simulator expects:
- Current execution state
- Available context
- Goal description
- Tool availability manifest

### Output Format
The simulator produces either:
- **Tool Request**: Structured call for external data
- **Processing Result**: Direct output when sufficient context exists
- **State Update**: Modified execution state

### Tool Request Schema
```json
{
  "action": "TOOL_REQUEST",
  "tool_name": "WebFetch|Read|Write|Bash|Task",
  "reasoning": "Why this tool call is needed",
  "parameters": {
    "specific_tool_params": "values"
  },
  "expected_outcome": "What information this will provide",
  "next_state": "Expected state after tool completion"
}
```

### Processing Result Schema
```json
{
  "action": "PROCESSING_RESULT", 
  "content": "Generated content/analysis",
  "confidence": 0.95,
  "state_update": {
    "current_step": "updated_step",
    "variables": {"updated": "variables"}
  },
  "completion_status": "CONTINUE|COMPLETE"
}
```

## Simulation Logic

The simulator implements the core decision-making pattern learned from training data:

1. **Context Assessment**: Evaluate available information against current goal
2. **Information Gap Analysis**: Identify missing data needed to proceed
3. **Tool Selection**: Choose appropriate external tool based on information need
4. **Request Formulation**: Structure tool call with specific parameters
5. **Result Integration**: Process tool output and update context
6. **Workflow Continuation**: Proceed with enhanced context

## Training Data Patterns

The simulation is based on these patterns from AGI-OS training data:

### Pattern 1: Web Data Acquisition
```
State: Need current information
Gap: No live data about topic X
Tool: WebFetch with specific URL and prompt
Result: Raw content for analysis
Continue: Process fetched content
```

### Pattern 2: File Operations
```
State: Need to persist/retrieve data
Gap: Content not in current context
Tool: Read/Write with file path
Result: Content available in context
Continue: Use content for next step
```

### Pattern 3: Complex Analysis
```
State: Need specialized processing
Gap: Task beyond current capabilities
Tool: Task with sub-agent prompt
Result: Processed analysis
Continue: Integrate analysis into workflow
```

## Simulation Modes

### Mode 1: Interactive Simulation
- Step-by-step execution with human confirmation
- Shows decision points and reasoning
- Demonstrates tool request patterns

### Mode 2: Autonomous Simulation  
- Continuous execution mimicking fine-tuned behavior
- Automatic tool calls and result integration
- End-to-end workflow completion

### Mode 3: Training Validation
- Compares simulation behavior to training data
- Validates decision patterns and tool usage
- Measures accuracy of tool request predictions

## Implementation Details

The simulator uses AGI-OS's existing components but adds:
- **Decision Logic**: Pattern matching from training data
- **Tool Request Generation**: Structured output formatting
- **Context Management**: State tracking across tool calls
- **Reasoning Transparency**: Visible decision-making process

## Success Criteria

A successful simulation demonstrates:
1. **Autonomous Decision Making**: LLM decides when external calls are needed
2. **Accurate Tool Selection**: Chooses correct tools for information gaps
3. **Structured Requests**: Formats tool calls properly
4. **Context Integration**: Uses tool results effectively
5. **Goal Achievement**: Completes workflows without human intervention

This simulation provides the blueprint for training an LLM to operate as an autonomous agent that can make external tool calls when needed, similar to Claude Code's capabilities.

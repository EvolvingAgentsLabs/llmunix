# LLMunix Kernel

## Core Architecture

LLMunix is an AI-powered operating system that dynamically generates tools and commands using the AGI-OS framework structure. The kernel operates as an intelligent orchestrator that can create, execute, and manage system resources on-demand.

### Kernel Components

#### 1. Dynamic Tool Generator (DTG)
- Analyzes user intent and system state
- Generates tool definitions in markdown format
- Registers tools in SmartLibrary with appropriate metadata
- Maps tools to Claude Code native functions

#### 2. Memory Controller
- Manages SmartMemory for persistent learning
- Tracks execution patterns and optimization opportunities
- Maintains system state across sessions
- Implements garbage collection for unused tools

#### 3. Process Manager
- Tracks execution states using ExecutionStateTemplate
- Manages concurrent tool execution
- Handles error recovery and rollback
- Maintains process hierarchy and dependencies

#### 4. File System Interface
- Uses AGI-OS folder structure as native file system
- Maps virtual paths to component definitions
- Provides CRUD operations on system components
- Maintains version control for component evolution

### Boot Sequence

1. **System Initialization**
   - Load system/SmartMemory.md for persistent state
   - Parse system/SmartLibrary.md for available components
   - Initialize workspace/ as active execution environment

2. **Service Startup**
   - Start Dynamic Tool Generator with Claude Code tool mappings
   - Initialize Memory Controller with learning algorithms
   - Launch Process Manager with state tracking
   - Mount File System Interface with component registry

3. **Shell Ready**
   - Present LLMunix prompt
   - Accept user commands and intents
   - Begin dynamic tool generation and execution

### Dynamic Tool Generation Process

1. **Intent Analysis**
   - Parse user command or natural language request
   - Identify required capabilities and constraints
   - Check SmartLibrary for existing components

2. **Tool Synthesis**
   - Generate tool definition in markdown format
   - Map to appropriate Claude Code native tools
   - Define input/output specifications and error handling

3. **Registration and Execution**
   - Register tool in SmartLibrary with metadata
   - Create execution state in workspace/
   - Execute tool and capture results

4. **Learning and Optimization**
   - Record execution patterns in SmartMemory
   - Update tool definitions based on performance
   - Optimize for future similar requests

### System Calls Interface

```markdown
## generate_tool(intent, requirements)
- **Purpose**: Create new tool based on user intent
- **Input**: Natural language intent, technical requirements
- **Output**: Tool definition and registration status
- **Example**: generate_tool("monitor CPU usage", {"real_time": true, "format": "json"})

## execute_command(command, args)
- **Purpose**: Execute system command or user-defined tool
- **Input**: Command name and arguments
- **Output**: Execution results and state updates
- **Example**: execute_command("webscrape", {"url": "example.com", "format": "markdown"})

## manage_memory(operation, target)
- **Purpose**: Control SmartMemory operations
- **Input**: Operation type (read, write, optimize, clear), target data
- **Output**: Memory state and operation results
- **Example**: manage_memory("optimize", "execution_patterns")

## file_operation(path, operation, data)
- **Purpose**: File system operations on AGI-OS structure
- **Input**: Virtual path, operation type, data payload
- **Output**: File operation results and system state
- **Example**: file_operation("/components/tools/", "create", tool_definition)
```

### Resource Management

#### Memory Management
- **SmartMemory**: Persistent learning and pattern recognition
- **Execution Cache**: Temporary storage for active processes
- **Component Registry**: Tool and agent definitions with metadata
- **State Snapshots**: Rollback points for error recovery

#### Process Scheduling
- **Priority Queue**: High-priority system operations first
- **Dependency Resolution**: Ensure required components are available
- **Concurrent Execution**: Parallel tool execution where possible
- **Error Handling**: Graceful degradation and recovery

#### File System
- **Virtual File System**: AGI-OS structure as native file system
- **Component Versioning**: Track evolution of tools and agents
- **Access Control**: Manage permissions for system components
- **Backup and Recovery**: Automatic snapshots of critical state

### Security Model

#### Sandboxing
- Each generated tool runs in isolated execution context
- Limited access to system resources based on declared requirements
- Automatic permission escalation requests for sensitive operations

#### Validation
- Generated tools undergo syntax and safety validation
- Runtime monitoring for unexpected behavior
- Automatic rollback for failed or dangerous operations

#### Audit Trail
- Complete execution history in SmartMemory
- Tool generation and modification logs
- Performance metrics and resource usage tracking

### Extension Points

#### Custom Tool Templates
- User-defined templates for common tool patterns
- Template inheritance and composition
- Automatic optimization based on usage patterns

#### Plugin Architecture
- External component integration
- API endpoints for third-party tools
- Managed plugin lifecycle and updates

#### Learning Algorithms
- Reinforcement learning for tool optimization
- Pattern recognition for predictive tool generation
- User behavior modeling for personalized experience

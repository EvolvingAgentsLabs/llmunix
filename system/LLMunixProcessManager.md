### Core Process Types

#### 1. Tool Processes
```markdown
## Tool Execution Process

- **State**: Pending → Running → Completed/Failed/Cancelled
- **Resources**: Memory allocation, CPU time, I/O access
- **Context**: Execution parameters, input data, output handling

## Process Structure
PID: 001
├── Tool: WebFetchTool
├── State: Running
├── Priority: Normal
├── Resources: 156MB memory, 12% CPU
├── Progress: 67% (2 of 3 URLs processed)

├── Owner: user@llmunix
└── Context: /workspace/research-project/
```

#### 2. Agent Processes
